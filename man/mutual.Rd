\usage{
mutual(
  data,
  group,
  unit,
  within = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  contribution.from = NULL,
  components = FALSE,
  cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table of class 'mutual.data'.}

\item{group}{A categorical variable name or vector of categorical variables names contained in \code{data}, or also,
a column number or vector of column numbers of \code{data}. Defines the first dimension over which segregation is
computed.}

\item{unit}{A categorical variable name or vector of categorical variables names contained in \code{data}, or also,
a column number or vector of column numbers of \code{data}. Defines the second dimension over which segregation is
computed.}

\item{within}{A categorical variable name or vector of categorical variables names contained in \code{data}, or also,
a column number or vector of column numbers of \code{data}. Defines the dimensions within which segregation is
computed. By default is NULL.}

\item{by}{A categorical variable name or vector of categorical variables names contained in \code{data}, or also,
a column number or vector of column numbers of \code{data}. Defines the dimensions by which calculations are
separated. By default is NULL.}

\item{contribution.from}{A variable of character type that can be 'group_vars' or 'unit_vars', or also, a categorical
variable name or vector of categorical variables names contained in the \code{group} parameter or \code{unit}
parameter, or also, a column number or vector of column numbers in the \code{group} parameter or the \code{unit}
parameter. Defines the dimension over which the exclusive segregation effect into the total segregation is wished
to calculate. By default is NULL.}

\item{components}{A boolean value. If TRUE and the \code{within} option is not NULL and the \code{by} option is NULL,
then returns a list where the first element is a data.table that contains a summary of the index total value and
decompositions while the second element is a data.table with more detail information of the decomposition of the
within term. Besides, if the \code{within} and \code{by} options are not NULL, then the function returns a list of
lists where each first element is a data.table that contains the summary of the index total value and decompositions,
while each second element is a data.table with more detail information of the decomposition of the within term
displayed in each first element. The detailed information about the elements needed for the linear combination that
produces the within term. By default is FALSE.}

\item{cores}{A positive integer. Defines the amount of CPU cores to use in parallelization tasks. If NULL, then the
compute is carried out sequentially in only one core. This option is available to Mac, Linux, Unix, and BSD systems
but is not available to Windows sytems. By default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data.table if the \code{components} option is false; a list if the \code{components} option is true and
the \code{within} option is not null and the \code{by} option is null; or a list of lists if the \code{components}
option is true and the \code{within} and \code{by} options are not null.
}
\description{
Calculating the mutual information index. It can be decomposed into its "between" and "within" terms. The
"within" terms can also be decomposed into their contributions, either by group or unit characteristics. The factors
that produce each "within" term can also be displayed at the user's request. The results can be calculated
considering a variable or sets of variables that define separate clusters.
}
\details{
Mixing \code{group} variables with \code{unit} variables in \code{contributions.from} will produce an error.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get the total segregation.
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school")

# Using the 'by' option to separate the calculations according to particular dimension or
# multiple dimensions.
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", by = "region")

# Use the 'within' option to decompose the index total value into the between term and the
# within term.
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", within = "etnia")

# Use the 'components' option to get detail information. The result shows the proportions
# and the local segregation index on the 'W_Decomposition' element. The weighted average
# between 'p' and 'within' is equal to the within term.
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", within = "etnia",
component = TRUE)

# Use the 'contribution.from' option to evaluate the exclusive segregating effect of
# certain characteristics into the total segregation.
## Contribution from of all variables of 'group' elements:
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", by = "region",
contribution.from = "group_vars")

## Contribution only from 'etnia' variable:
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", by = "region",
contribution.from = "etnia")

# Use the 'cores' option to increase the CPU cores into the index compute.
mutual(data = DT_Seg_Chile, group = c("csep", "etnia"), unit = "school", by = "region",
cores = 2)
