\description{
The data set included in this package was build using two data sets. The first one is the student
enrollment reported by the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) <http://datosabiertos.mineduc.cl/> for students of primary
education (first eight years of formal education) who attended establishments officially recognized by the State.
The second one is the Quality and Context of Education Questionnaire for Parents and Guardians, and the Student
Questionnaire, both applied by the Education Quality Agency <http://www.agenciaeducacion.cl/> to all students in
grades 4 and 8 of primary education. Both sources are limited to the period 2016-2018. Contains information related
to students and educational system characteristics in southern Chile (BioBio, La Araucania and Los Rios regions).
